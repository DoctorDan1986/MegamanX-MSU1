Mega Man X MSU-1 hack
by DarkShock

This hack adds support for the MSU-1 chip invented by byuu that
supports CD quality audio and streaming 4Gb of data. This hack only uses the audio part of the
chip.

The hack is made for the 1.1 version of the game. Tested on SD2SNES, higan 094.
bsnes 075 still have issues with the game (probably a wrong .xml file).
